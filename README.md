# React Chuck Norris Jokes App

After running `npm i` the app should automatically run and launch on http://localhost:9000

This loads 10 random Chuck Norris jokes from the API http://icndb.com/. You're can choose up to 10 favourites, and they will be saved in browser local storage.

A checkbox can be checked to add a random joke to favourites every 3 seconds. However, the favourite limit will be capped at 10.
